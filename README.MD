## üîß Configuration

The project requires a `.env` file for environment variables in the backend.

1.  Navigate to the `backend` folder.
2.  Create a copy of the `.env.example` file or create a new file named `.env`.
3.  Fill the `.env` file with your own keys and credentials:

````env
# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
DB_DATABASE=kendyl_db # Make sure to create this database in Postgres

# Secret for JSON Web Tokens
JWT_SECRET=THIS-IS-A-VERY-SECURE-SECRET-CHANGE-ME

# API Keys for External Services
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
DAILY_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

## üèÅ Getting Started & Usage Flow

To use the application, you must perform an initial setup to create users and skills. Using **Postman** is recommended for these steps.

---

## 1. Register Users (Required Step)

Before you can log in through the UI, you must register at least one user of each type.

**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:3001/auth/register`

**Body to register a Talent:**
```json
{
  "email": "talent.test@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "role": "talent"
}

**Body to register a business:**
```json
{
  "email": "business.test@example.com",
  "password": "strongpassword456",
  "role": "business"
}

---

## **2.Create Skills (Required for Businesses)**

Before a business can create a job offer, skills must exist in the database.

**Endpoint:** `POST http://localhost:3001/jobs/skills`

**Body: **
```json

{
  "name": "PostgreSQL"
}

Repeat this step for all the skills you want (e.g., "React", "Node.js", "Java", etc.).

---

## **3. Using the Application**

Once the initial setup is complete:

If you log in as a business: You will see the jobs dashboard and a button to "+ Create New Offer". The form will allow you to select the skills you created in the previous step.

If you log in as a talent: You will see the list of published job offers with a button to "Start Interview" for each one. Click it to begin your interview with the AI!
